# Training Results: Evidence of Agent Learning

## Early Training Analysis (756 Timesteps)

**Objective Analysis of 756-Timestep Training Session**

Analysis of fresh training with the new natural log reward system reveals early learning indicators but highlights the need for extended training duration.

### **Key Findings at 756 Timesteps:**

**Positive Learning Signals:**
- **Level Completions Occurring**: Multiple level completion events detected with 4.83 bonus rewards applied to trajectory steps
- **Policy Learning Activity**: clip_fraction ranging from 0.0 to 0.732, indicating active policy updates during learning phases  
- **Value Function Stability**: value_loss in 0.500-0.560 range (successfully unstuck from 0.5, confirming natural log scaling effectiveness)
- **Maintained Exploration**: entropy_loss decreasing from -1.38 to -1.01 (becoming more decisive while preserving exploration)

**Areas of Concern:**
- **Very Low Meaningful Ratio**: 0.0-0.45% of actions result in meaningful game state changes. Note that a recent update to the dynamic rollout process has addressed this issue. 
- **High Quality Variance**: Trajectory quality ranges 0.05-40.63, indicating inconsistent performance
- **Limited Episode Depth**: Successful completions only 9-17 steps, suggesting early-level solutions only

**Technical Health Indicators:**
- ✅ Natural log reward scaling functional (rewards ~4.83 for completions)
- ✅ Life loss filtering operational (3000+ pixel changes → 0.0 rewards)
- ✅ Credit assignment working (trajectory-wide bonuses applied correctly)  
- ✅ Training stability maintained (consistent 0.0003 learning rate, no divergence)

**Conclusion**: The model shows promising early learning signs at 756 timesteps with successful level completions and proper value function learning. However, the very low meaningful interaction ratio (0.0-0.45%) suggests predominantly random exploration. Extended training duration needed to develop sophisticated gameplay patterns.
